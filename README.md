### Overview

Optimally efficient, fine grained, truly reactive DOM programming in CLJS, without React, without _virtual dom_, without a separate store. Here is an in-depth ["quick start"](https://kennytilton.github.io/web-mx-quickstart/#/) overview, and this [hands-on](https://github.com/kennytilton/web-mx/blob/main/doc/intro-clock.md) introduction will explain the vital "why" behind these fundamental architectural differences. It is strongly recommended to newcomers and tire-kickers.

> Related work: [Javascript/MX](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix/tree/main/js/matrix) drives this [AskHN "Who's Hiring?" browser](https://kennytilton.github.io/whoishiring/). Work on React/MX and RN/MX has reached POC, but we have shifted focus to [Flutter/MX](https://github.com/kennytilton/flutter-mx/blob/main/README.md). 

### Just Run It

Web/MX is a library, but can also be run as a Web app to try examples.

To run the current example, just:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kennytilton/web-mx.git
cd web-mx
clojure -M -m figwheel.main --build quick-start --repl
```
After a minute or so the `quick-start` example should appear in your browser at `http://localhost:9500/quick-start.html`, leaving a CLJS REPL in the original terminal.

Other examples are `ticktock`, `todomvc`, and `rxtrak`.

### Other Working Examples
The classic, [TodoMVC](https://github.com/kennytilton/mxtodomvc) with some tutorial doc.

[rxTrak](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix/tree/master/cljc/rxtrak) takes [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) to a new level by incorporating an AJAX lookup of each "to-do", now rX prescription, on the [FDA Drug database](https://open.fda.gov/apis/) looking adverse events with that drug. 

A full [Web/MX "Who's Hiring?"](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix/tree/main/cljc/whoshiring) app

And of course the [training guide](https://github.com/kennytilton/mxweb-trainer/wiki) is full of smaller working examples (but needs updating).
