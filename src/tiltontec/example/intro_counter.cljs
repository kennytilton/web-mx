;;; --- intro counter -----------------------------------
;;; Architectural design:
;;; 1. We just do standard HTML/CSS;
;;; 1.a. But composites of "just html" are allowed, via parameterized  function composition
;;;      So we are not limited to HTML atoms. To a degree, this delivers HTML components. (?)
;;; 1.b. We can include CLJS in the HTML generation (map genning kids)
;;; 1.c. And we get a lot of syntactic sugar for specifying children. Transparent, actually.
;;;      The macros and lexical capture hide a lot.
;;; 2. "omniscience": formulas can work off any app state, via navigation
;;; 2.a structural navigation
;;; 2.b name etc navigation
;;; 2.c function navigation
;;; 3. property-to-property reactivity
;;; 3.a. allows reliable "in place" state management: reactivity all the way to the leaf; no separate store;
;;; 3.b. view is state, a first-class citizen: the color attribute of the style gets its own formula;
;;; 3.c. update efficiency, without VDOM/diffing.
;;; 4. "omnipotence": event handlers can mutate at will.
;;; 5. "observers/watches": external; interval cleanuo, loggin
;;; 6. "with-cc" observer internal DAG mutation;
;;; 7. "all-in": omnipresence, ubiquity; reactive everywhere VIA wrapping
;;; 7.a wrapping setTimeout
;;; 7.b wrapping XHR
;;; 7.c wrapping localStrage

;;; --- 1. It's just html -------------------------------------
;;; We still program HTML. Please find detailed notes following the code.

;;; Where HTML has <tag attributes*> children* </tag>...
;;; Web/MX has (tag [HTML-attribute-map [custom-attr-map]] children*)
;;; Keywords become strings in HTML.
;;; Otherwise, MDN is your guide.

;;; --- omniscience -----------------------------
;;; Any component can pull information it needs from anywhere, using
;;; "formulas" that can navigate to any object for any property.

;;; 1. We use the second custom property map to give the <span> a name, namely, :a-counter...
;;; 2. ...and also give the widget some custom state, the :count.
;;; 3. We derive the text for the counter display by navigating
;;;    to the parent and reading the :count.
;;; 3 & 4. two ways to navigate: by "hardpath" parent or 'kids', or by name via FMU
;;; 4. children of tags are wrapped in implicit formulas, and
;;;    can include arbitrary HLL code, accessing "me" as if it were "this" or "self"
;;; 5. derive the "...N" spans by
;;;   a. navigating to the widget named :a-counter; and
;;;   b. reading its :count property.
;;;
;;; For those wondering, dependency cycles throw an exception at runtime.

;;; --- omnipotence -----------------------------
;;; Any handler can navigate to any property to change it, with all
;;; dependencies updated before the MSET! or MSWAP! call returns.

;;; --- observer/watch dataflow initiation ----------------------
;;; It is not uncommon, when developing MX code, to encounter
;;; a use case where the dataflow can detect a need to mutate an input
;;; cell. These are often cases where the user has control, but the system
;;; wants to offer a U/X nicety by doing what the user would do. But user
;;; input comes from controls operating on MX input cells.
;;; To this end, MX allows observers to enqueue, via `with-cc`, mset!/mswap! code for execution
;;; immediately following the processing of the current mutation.

;;; In the example below, we want the user to control the counter, but we also want
;;; an automatic safeguard should the count reach a "dangerous" level
