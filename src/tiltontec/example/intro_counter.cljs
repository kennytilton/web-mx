;;; --- observer/watch dataflow initiation ----------------------

;;; cell. These are often cases where the user has control, but the system
;;; wants to offer a U/X nicety by doing what the user would do. But user
;;; input comes from controls operating on MX input cells.
;;; To this end, MX allows observers to enqueue, via `with-cc`, mset!/mswap! code for execution
;;; immediately following the processing of the current mutation.

;;; In the example below, we want the user to control the counter, but we also want
;;; an automatic safeguard should the count reach a "dangerous" level
