;; --- convenient accessors ---------------------
;;
;; One point of friction while coding with Matrix is
;; navigating the Matrix to information we need to
;; code up any given functionality.
;;
;; In this case, navigation is by the Matrix pseudo-tyoe,
;; handled by the function 'mxu-find-type'.
;;
;; Matrix includes quite a menagerie of utilities
;; to find other nodes in the Matrix, akin to various
;; ways of authoring CSS selectors.
;;
;; Would a one-atom DB approach work? Not really, for reasons
;; involving the Matrix life-cycle, an advanced topic we would
;; like to defer.

;; Unsurprisingly, the state of the to-dos themselves
;; drives most of the TodoMVC dynamic behavior being exercised.
;; Below we wrap up navigation to that data structure.
